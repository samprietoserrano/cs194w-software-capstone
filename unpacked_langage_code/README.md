# LanGage Learning

We are team 23 and we created the product LanGage, which is a language-learning tool that makes use of foreign-language videos on Youtube.  

LanGage uses LLM and Chrome browser extension functionality to analyze the video the user plays within the Youtube web player to provide quick and short vocab review as scenes play out. At the end of the video the tool concludes with a short “quiz” where users are asked to translate the vocab they reviewed during the video. 

## How to Use

To use LanGage Learning extension, follow these steps [watch this video](https://youtu.be/zoToloyLYDc), or check out our [user test plan/guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W-YhnBGYRKQQXwsacz95ba6MvLcF2vRikRFN4LP7wNw/edit?usp=sharing):

1. Go to any non-English-language YouTube video that has subtitles.
2. On the embedded panel, select the 5 terms you want to review as translation during the video
3. Enjoy the video with our periodic vocab displays, either in the panel or the in-player notidication for full screen.

## Notes

- This code fetches the YouTube video transcripts, and thus the platform might change the change the permission in allowing us to do this freely. So that could break this code in the future.
